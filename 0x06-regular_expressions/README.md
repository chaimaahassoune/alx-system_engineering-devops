3. [Repetition Token #2](./3-repetition_token_2.rb): Create a Ruby script that matches a different pattern with repetitions.
4. [Repetition Token #3](./4-repetition_token_3.rb): Create a Ruby script that matches repetitions without square brackets.
5. [Not Quite HBTN Yet](./5-beginning_and_end.rb): Create a Ruby script that matches strings starting with 'h' and ending with 'n'.
